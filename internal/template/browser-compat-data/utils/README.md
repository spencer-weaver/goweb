# Experimental utilities

These are experimental utilities for working with compat data, which may inform future work on the project's API. The modules in this directory are NOT included in the released `@mdn/browser-compat-data` package. They are NOT covered by the [_Semantic versioning policy_](../README.md#Semantic-versioning-policy); backwards compatibility is not assured. With those limitations in mind, you're free to experiment with these utilities and [provide feedback](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues/new/choose).
